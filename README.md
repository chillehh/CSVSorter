# CSVSorter created by Jacob Ling 17/11/21

This program takes 3 input arguments:

    - The path to the .csv file for sorting.
    
    - The name of the first column to be sorted in ascending order.
    
    - The name of the second column to be sorted in descending order.


It will then read the .csv file and sort the table by the first column in ascending order and then by the second column in descending order.

Finally, it will output the top three results to the command line in YAML formatted text.
